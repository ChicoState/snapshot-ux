# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Snapshot is an application designed for Windows that allows users to extract text from a image using screen shots. This free tool is useful for anyone looking to quickly copy text from documents, presentations, and web pages without the need for manual typing. For this phase, our team focused on improving user interaction and identifying potential issues through Cognitive Walkthroughs and Informal feedback.

## Methods

A Cognitive Walkthrough was conducted on our application, involving three participants (n=3) who were UX students. Each participant was instructed to select a persona and its corresponding scenario from Phase 1, and then perform a task using our wireframes. Throughout the process, participants documented each action taken and any underlying assumptions. At each step, they were asked to reflect on the following two questions: Will the user know what to do at this step? and If the user performs the correct action, will they recognize that they have done so and are making progress toward their goal?

Informal feedback was given after our live demo was presented to a class of software engineering students (n=35). These students were asked if they prefer a display pop-up with text, display text in application window, automatically copy text to window? Additionally, they could provide their own unique idea or improvement of an existing functionality. 

## Findings

Following the analysis of our Cognitive Walkthrough results, several issues were identified, concerning the location of the settings page, user expectations regarding functionality, and navigation challenges. Participants experienced difficulty locating the settings page, which affected their ability to successfully complete a task. Some users expected the presence of a search functionality to browse through saved files. Finally, certain pages lacked clear labeling, resulting in confusion among users about whether they had made the right decision.

## Conclusions

The Cognitive Walkthrough revealed key usability issues related to navigation clarity, unmet user expectations for functionality, and insufficient page labeling. Participants consistently struggled to locate the settings page, indicating that critical navigation elements were not easily discoverable. This can be addressed by repositioning the settings icon to a more prominent location and using universally recognized symbols. Users also expected a search functionality to browse through saved files, suggesting that implementing a searchable file management feature would better support efficient task completion. Additionally, the lack of clear page labeling caused user confusion and uncertainty about whether they had navigated to the correct location. This can be mitigated by incorporating descriptive headers and visual indicators on each page. Together, these findings suggest a misalignment between the current interface and user mental models. Future design models should incorporate these specific improvements and undergo additional usability testing to ensure the interface meets user expectations.

## Caveats

It is important to consider the inexperience of the team members (n=2) as our wireframes could have represented the flow of our application more accurately which had a negative impact on our Cognitive Walkthroughs. This resulted in confusion completing tasks and a poor reflection of our screen flow. As previously mentioned, inexperienced UX students were selected to conduct Cognitive Walkthroughs on our app which could have impacted our results. They could have potentially missed important details or focused on the wrong things.
