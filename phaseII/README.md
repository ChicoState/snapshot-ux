# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Snapshot is an application designed for Windows that allows users to extract text from a image using screen shots. This free tool is useful for anyone looking to quickly copy text from documents, presentations, and web pages without the need for manual typing. For this phase, our team focused on improving user interaction and identifying potential issues through Cognitive Walkthroughs and Informal feedback.

## Methods

A Cognitive Walkthrough was conducted on our application, involving three participants (n=3) who were UX students. Each participant was instructed to select a persona and its corresponding scenario from Phase 1, and then perform a task using our wireframes. Throughout the process, participants documented each action taken and any underlying assumptions. At each step, they were asked to reflect on the following two questions: Will the user know what to do at this step? and If the user performs the correct action, will they recognize that they have done so and are making progress toward their goal?

Informal feedback was given after our live demo was presented to a class of software engineering students (n=35). These students were asked if they prefer a display pop-up with text, display text in application window, automatically copy text to window? Additionally, they could provide their own unique idea or improvement of an existing functionality. 

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

It is important to consider the inexperience of the team members (n=2) as our wireframes could have more accurately represented the flow of our application which had a direct impact on our cognitive walkthroughs. This resulted in confusion and a poor reflection of our screen flow.

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
