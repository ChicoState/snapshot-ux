Kathy 76,
Retired science teacher
She likes spending time with her grandchildren and enjoys activities that don’t require a lot of physical movement. Kathy is easy-going, but struggles with technology. She wants to be able to easily access and modify text from old pictures and needs to enlarge text to easily read the screen. She likes to keep up with technology but does not have a deep understanding or desire to customize settings or troubleshoot applications.

Kyle 19,
College freshman
Kyle is taking six classes, not because he wants to but his father will be disappointed if he underperformes in school. He is quick to anger and is quickly becoming notorious for causing fist-sized holes to appear in drywall. 
Kyle needs to be able to copy and paste text from websites that prevent it so that he can more efficiently complete his classwork. He hates that he needs a separate device for two step verification and is quick to anger when computers don't do what he wants. 


# Scenarios

Kyle has found that many online documents and articles either prevent copy/paste or are photocopies of printed documents, this can make it difficult to quote articles or save excerpts. Kyle is a busy student and is short on time to complete his assignments because he parties all weekend.


Kathy has recently uploaded several images of past students' science projects. She wants to be able to find the projects done by her favorite students but she finds it hard to read the text on the images and does not have the time to read through every project. 


John recently found out his windows computer doesn’t have an easy method to copy text from an image. All potential applications require a premium subscription and will add on to his monthly subscriptions. This adds time to complete simple tasks at his job, and he is frustrated.
