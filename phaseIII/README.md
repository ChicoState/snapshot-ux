# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Snapshot is an application designed for Windows that allows users to extract text from an image using screen shots. This free tool is useful for anyone looking to quickly copy text from documents, presentations, and web pages without the need for manual typing. For this phase, our team focused on user interaction and improving flow using data collected from our usability tests.

## Methods

This phase our team conducted usability tests for our application, these tests were conducted six times with six different participants. All participants were fellow UX students who volunteered to participate in our study. Participants were asked to carry out specific tests that our team determined would provide the most insight into the flow of our application. Participants described their thought process as they moved through the application and were asked questions about their experience after completing the test.

## Findings

Following analysis of our usability tests we were able to locate multiple points of contention with the use of our application. These issues consisted of 
    a: lack of feedback when the screenshot is taken 
    b: poor organization with settings in the settings menu and file save menu 
    c: general confusion regarding the home page buttons, and lack of a “help” menu

## Conclusions

The usability test revealed issues with our organization system and the need to reformat our settings and file save menus. It also highlighted the need for help menus and feedback when a user is completing a task. 

## Caveats

All participants were part of the same UX class and were of similar age range and technological literacy. Additionally all participants were familiar with the wireframe application used and the usability test process, these aspects could impact their behavior during the test.
