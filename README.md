# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive Analysis highlighted the lack of free OCR applications across all platforms. Users are required to pay a subscription fee in order to use an OCR feature.
* Conducting Heuristic evaluation revealed a major weakness in error prevention in our closest competitor 
* Users should have the ability to confirm the proposed text from our application
* Personas and Scenarios found our users to value time and simplicity. Our application must prioritize:
    * Easy-to-follow UI
    * Fast responses
