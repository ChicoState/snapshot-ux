# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive Analysis highlighted the lack of free OCR applications across all platforms. Users are required to pay a subscription fee in order to use an OCR feature.
* Conducting Heuristic evaluation revealed a major weakness in error prevention in our closest competitor 
* Users should have the ability to confirm the proposed text from our application
* Personas and Scenarios found our users to value time and simplicity. Our application must prioritize:
    * Easy-to-follow UI
    * Fast responses

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* **Informal feedback** illustrated new and improved functionalities our application could provide such as:
   * Mathematical formula and symbol recognition: users will be able to copy and paste several math equations and symbols instead of manually typing them
   * Improved interface and smaller window size: users will have a smaller pop-up screen and interface similar to the windows snipping tool to allow for easier navigation and identification of buttons
* **Cognitive Walkthrough** revealed some basic tasks were difficult or impossible to complete due to a lack of functionality or unusual button appearances. These tasks include saving a file, searching for a specific file , and locating the settings page.
* Wireframes were thoughtfully and accurately modified to align with user feedback and satisfaction by:
   * Modifying UI to be more similar to windows snipping tool
	* Displaying a smaller window size 
	* Changing the appearances of certain buttons to be more apparent
