# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Snapshot is an application designed for Windows that allows users to extract text from a image using screen shots. This free tool is useful for anyone looking to quickly copy text from documents, presentations, and web pages without the need for manual typing.

## Methods

The UX-team used multiple research methods to get an understanding of similar applications on the market and to better understand the needs of our users. These methods included; competitive analysis, heuristic evaluation, and the creation of personas & scenarios.

Competitive analysis was done by selecting three competitors and evaluating them based on their strengths, weaknesses, quality, price, and the platforms these competitors were available on. The products chosen were; ChatGPT, Adobe Acrobat Pro, and Preview.

Heuristic evaluation was done by selecting a competitor, Chat-GPT, and rating their application on a set of criteria from 1 to 10. We took notes on the strengths and weaknesses of the application for each heuristic so we could better learn our aplicationâ€™s niche in the market. 

The UX-team collectively created three personas along with three scenarios corresponding to these personas. Each persona had an image, name, and detailed description of their personality. Scenarios contained the name of the corresponding persona along with information about the task the user wanted to accomplish.   

## Findings

Competitive analysis gave us a better understanding of the niche that our application would fill, there are many other applications that accomplish similar tasks to Snapshot however they all lack in ease and speed of use.

Through our heuristic evaluations we were able to determine that ChatGPT was very good at performing OCR and was very easy to use, however the process was not streamlined for the specific goal of quickly generating text that can be seen on screen. 

Our personas and scenarios gave us a better understanding of customer desires for our application. These mostly focused on the speed and practicality of our application as well as ease of use.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

Our team faced several limitations due to our methods. For example, the majority of our competitors required a paid subscription in order to use their product which limited our team's ability to conduct a thorough analysis of our competition. This resulted in having a poor candidate for Heuristic Evaluation and poor view of the market.

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
